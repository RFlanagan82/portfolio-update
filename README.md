## Description
The portfolio site contained in this repository has been created from the skills I've learned thus far within the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp - Fall 2020 cohort.

This site contains 4 pages to include:

- [Index Page](https://rflanagan82.github.io/rfportfolionew/)
- [About Page](https://rflanagan82.github.io/rfportfolionew/about.html)
- [Portfolio](https://rflanagan82.github.io/rfportfolionew/portfolio.html)
- [Contact](https://rflanagan82.github.io/rfportfolionew/contact.html)

The site also contains a link to my latest resume as a PDF file.

## Updates
This time around I have incorporated flexbox elements to see how they would work within my new portfolio.

My phone number has also been moved to the footer bar.

I also plan on incorporating Mongoose and building a database to hold those who complete my contact me form in the near future.
